# dv-sim

This is an older Clojure project [deployed at Heroku][1] that allows a
QWERTY touch typist to feel what it is like to type in Dvorak.

It is based on [ClojureScript One][2], which is largely not as
necessary given current available tools but at the time it was
convenient and an easy way to learn.
